| File                     | AI-Generated Probability (1-100) | Key signals / rationale                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dockerfile               | 70                               | Standard Dockerfile structure with conventional commands, but the entrypoint script is complex and specific, suggesting human refinement. |
| README-cloudshell.txt    | 90                               | This is a generic, boilerplate text typically provided by Google Cloud Shell.             |
| README.md                | 30                               | The file is well-structured with detailed explanations and code examples, but the overall tone and structure feel more human-curated, especially after recent edits. |
| deploy.sh                | 50                               | The script uses common gcloud commands and bash scripting, but the specific logic and error handling indicate significant human authorship. |
| generate_clusters.py     | 40                               | The script has a clear purpose with straightforward Python code and comments, indicating more human-like authorship than a purely AI-generated script. |
| pipeline.yaml            | 80                               | This appears to be a standard Kubeflow pipeline definition, likely generated or adapted from a template. |
| plot_results.py          | 50                               | The Python script uses matplotlib for plotting, which is common, but the specific plot details and formatting suggest human customization. |
| prepare_arc.py           | 40                               | The script involves data processing logic with specific formatting for the ARC dataset, showing signs of human development and understanding of the data. |
| requirements.txt         | 80                               | This is a standard requirements file, often generated or maintained with tools, listing common Python packages. |
| run_dcbs_eval.py         | 60                               | The script is complex, involving model loading, evaluation loops, and detailed result logging, suggesting a mix of generated boilerplate and human-written logic. |
| src/__init__.py          | 95                               | This is a minimal `__init__.py` file with a single, somewhat formal comment, characteristic of auto-generated or template files. |
| src/dcbs.py              | 30                               | The core algorithm and strategy classes have clear, concise code and docstrings that seem thoughtfully written by a human. |
| tests/__init__.py        | 95                               | Similar to `src/__init__.py`, this is a minimal file with a generic comment, likely auto-generated or a simple placeholder. |
| tests/test_cot.py        | 60                               | The test structure is standard for Python's unittest, but the specific test cases and setup logic indicate human involvement in designing the tests. |
| tests/test_dcbs.py       | 50                               | The test cases are specific to the DCBS algorithm, with carefully chosen inputs and assertions, suggesting human design and understanding. |
| configs/study_config.yaml | 60                               | The YAML structure is standard, but the specific values and comments suggest human input and project-specific configuration. |
